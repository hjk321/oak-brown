// SPOILERS AHEAD!

// This file has all the custom Pokédex text. You should probably turn back.

// Seriously, it's a lot more fun to discover these in-game.

// I wrote all of these custom texts so that you would be rewarded for actually filling your dex.

// How many other hacks do you think bothered? What better opportunity will

// you get to have a good reason to actually catch em all?

// Especially since I made dex completion one of the main draws of the game?

//

//

//

// Look, if not saying it's a bad thing you want to read all the dex entries at once.

// I'm just saying that once you do, that's it. You're not gonna want to catch anything in the game.

// It just won't be very fulfilling, that's all.

// I guess in the end it's up to you.
